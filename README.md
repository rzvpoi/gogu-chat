[![latest-tag](https://github.com/rzvpoi/gogu-chat/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
An unofficial desktop app for [Google Chat](http://chat.google.com) built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)

### Motivation
* Google is forcing users to use PWA
* You don't want to install Chrome; just to use a PWA. :wink:

### Installation (Mac OS only)
You can download the latest Mac OS installer from here:
[gogu-chat v1](https://github.com/rzvpoi/gogu-chat/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

After downloading the dmg you just need open it and drag the app in the Applications folder.

Other platforms will be available in the future, but you can build your own binary by your own.
